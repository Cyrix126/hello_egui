# egui_router

A single-page application router for [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

It supports:

- Customizable route transition animations
- Axum-like route matching and handler functions

Check out the [hello_egui demo](https://lucasmerlin.github.io/hello_egui/), which internally uses
egui_router to route between the examples and crates.
